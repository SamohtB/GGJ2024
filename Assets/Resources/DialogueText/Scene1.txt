Ok mods!
you know what the drill is 
normally you guys just have to keep chat in check 
but with me streaming
you got more to do
this is what you have to do for my show 
The Noryk Show!
OK? 
our whole appeal is to make this livestream 
feel like a TV talk show 
that uses sound effects
like laugh tracks
and sad AWWW noises 
recycled from dead peoples audio in the 60s 
but with a twist
we re using a soundboard full of memes 
my job is to be funny
your job is to make me funnier 
using the right sound 
to press at the right time 
press the wrong sound 
or miss the timing
and you ll make the view count smaller 
if it reaches zero
you re the one who s done for
you hear me? 
I need people to keep watching MY show 
and someones gotta do something right on this stream 
because I cant f*** up here
everyone likes me
so if anything goes wrong
its on you
        
alright!
lets not keep my people waiting 
I m sure they re already missing me
OH
and don t forget 
we got a guest coming over
he s in call with me right now
   
HEYYY everyone! 
How y all doing? 
Good?
Good? 
Good 
cause I m doing great 
I just got back from my summer cruise aaaand 
happened to meet someone there
while I was chilling down in the hot tub
someone decided to take a dip next to me 
who knew a professional was in the same cruise as me
and now he s appearing here as a guest? 
give it up for the one and only 
GOAT  
Eeyore!
Heyyyyyy ^_^
anyone who watches my channel
would know a streamer like Eeyore
Oh please  
a few million views is not that big 
I still have lots to go 
if I ever wanna 
churn out as much content as you do, Noryk
    
not that big  
no, no, man 
your channel is just a few months old
and you re already have a large following
Exactly
If I didn't
how could I even afford to go 
on that cruise the same as you did?
now that I think about it
didn t I see your parents there too? 
my bad about how I met them though 
I didn t realize who I was flirting with 
until your mom said 
NAH NAH dude I  
(clears throat) 
I get it
you re hard at work
you re on that grind
I respect that
money
b*****s
the fame
yeah yeah
exactlyyy
    
speaking of that cruise
I actually had a weird dream after I met you
For real?
yeah yeah 
here s the thing
I rarely ever get dreams 
so that s why I still remember this one up until now-
In the dream
I was actually in bed
but I couldn't get up
You were there sitting on the bedside 
with your back turned to me
but I was trying to catch your attention 
like Noryk ! 
Noryyyyk! 
but you just weren t looking! 
so I kept calling you
Noryyyk! 
Noooryyyk! 
until you finally looked! 
and then 
      
then what?
      
what bro???
We started wrestling
HUH
I m serious bro
I was on top 
and then you were 
actually
I think that s where you re wrong 
I think I would be the one who is on top
I mean not that I m complaining
but I m just saying
it s this dream I had
and I m not done 
listen here Eeyore
I can t let you take the reins on this show 
just when it started 
and this is my show 
we re talking about here
I m the one who should be 
taking the lead here
   
I think it s time to move on 
from telling stories about 
You re just jealous man 
What?!
Yeah 
I said it
That s the only reason you even invited me
to your lame-ass show
It s cause my popularity 
is rising faster than yours 
and I m earning more in a week 
than you ever could in a month
I ain t some stupid sadboi for you to exploit!
     
even though that s exactly 
why the algorithm loves me 
      
You  
You! 
You don t know a damn thing about me Eeyore! 
You re-
     
back me up here mods
you re just a noob in the livestreaming community!
You barely started out
and you re already making enemies 
with the wrong people
Whatever man
you just can t take a bottom joke
MODS! Don t encourage him!
