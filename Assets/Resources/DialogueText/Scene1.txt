Ok mods, you know what the drill is. 
Normally, you guys just have to keep chat in check, 
but with me streaming, 
you got more to do.
Show the soundboard. *The description for each sound appears*
This is what you have to do for my show. 
The Noryk Show, OK? 
Our whole appeal is to make this livestream feel like a TV talk show that uses sound effects 
like laugh tracks
and sad “Awww” noises 
recycled from dead people’s audio in the 60’s. 
But with a twist. 
We’re using a soundboard full of memes. 
My job is to be funny. 
Your job is to make me funnier using the right sound to press at the right time. 
Press the wrong sound or miss the timing, and you’ll make the view count smaller. 
If it reaches zero, you’re the one who’s done for, you hear me? 
I need people to keep watching my show, 
and someone’s gotta do something right on this stream because I can’t fuck up here. 
Everyone likes me, so if anything goes wrong, 
it's on you.
Alright.
Let’s not keep my people waiting. 
I’m sure they’re already missing me.
Oh, and don’t forget. 
We got a guest coming over, 
he’s in call with me right now.
*Livestream Starts/First Topic: Casual Talk. greetings then random topic (weird dreams)*
Hey everyone! 
How y’all doing? 
Good? Good? Good. 
‘cause I’m doing great. 
I just got back from my summer cruise aaaand 
happened to meet someone there. 
While I was chilling down in the hot tub, 
someone decided to take a dip next to me. 
Who knew a professional was in the same cruise as me, 
and now he’s appearing here as a guest? 
Give it up for the one and only GOAT… Eeyore!
Heyyyyyy ^_^
Anyone who watches my channel would know a streamer like Eeyore.
Oh please… 
a few million views is not that big, 
I still have lots to go if I ever wanna churn out as much content as you do, Noryk.
Not that big… 
no, no, man, your channel is just a few months old, 
and you’re already have a large following.
Exactly. 
If I didn't, how could I even afford to go on that cruise the same as you did?
Now that I think about it,
didn’t I see your parents there too? 
My bad about how I met them though, 
I didn’t realize who I was flirting with until your mom said—
NAH NAH dude I— 
ahem (clears throat)— 
I get it, 
you’re hard at work, 
you’re on that grind, 
I respect that. 
Money, 
bitches, 
the fame, 
yeah yeah
Exactlyyy, 
speaking of that cruise, 
I actually had a weird dream after I met you.
For real?
Yeah, yeah, here’s the thing. 
I rarely ever get dreams 
so that’s why I still remember this one up until now. 
In the dream, 
I was actually in bed, 
but I couldn't get up. 
You were there sitting on the bedside with your back turned to me,
but I was trying to catch your attention like “Noryk…! Noryyyyk!” 
but you just weren’t looking! So I kept calling you.
“Noryyyk! Noooryyyk!” 
Until you finally looked! 
And then…
Then what?
3 second silence.
Eeyore is visibly grinning.
What, bro???
We started wrestling.
Huh
I’m serious, bro. I was on top and then you were—
Actually,
I think that’s where you’re wrong. 
I think I would be the one who is on top.
